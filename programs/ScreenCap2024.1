.TH ScreenCap2024 1  "USBTMC DAQ"
.SH NAME
ScreenCap2024 \- fetch configuration from instrument
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ScreenCap2024
[OPTION]... [>imagefile]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is used to get a screen-capture from a Tektronix
2024B oscilloscope. It might work for other Tektronix products,
but might not.  There is a choice of graphics formats, which
is determined by the scope capabilities.
.PP
Please note that there is a long delay built into this program,
between sending the commands to generate the screen capture, and
the attempt to read the screen capture. This is to work around
device-driver timeouts, caused by the scope taking longer to
respond than the hardwired driver timeout. 
.PP
The device is (optionally) selected by manufacturer, product name,
and serial number, defaulting to a Tektronix TDS2024B. These
options use  simple shell-style 'glob' wildcards, so \"Tek*\" will
match \"Tektronix\".
